# FinalProject
## Segment 1 Machine Learning Model

For this segment we were asked to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine model.  
We have chosen to use a clustering model of machine learning (unsupervised machine learning) because the data we are looking at has many features (76 columns after preprocessing) without a clear output (y).  So many features will make determining the right inputs and the right number of clusters difficult.  As an initial attempt at fitting to machine learning, we created an elbow curve to determine the number of appropriate clusters looking for best `K` in `KMeans`



a selection of inputs (Total Enrollment, Average Tuition, and Total number of Applicants).
