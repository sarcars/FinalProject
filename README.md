U.S. College Admissions

What Colleges/Universities are in the U.S. & how can they be grouped to compare student demoprahics?

For this project, we choose to look at U.S. college admission information as it provided considerable datasets. We will be using clustering models to determine the best predictions for our data. In order to conduct this predictive modeling endeavor, we sourced our data from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samsonqian/college-admissions) which featured a csv file with information from 2010 to 2014.

# Database
For this first segment we are using the csv file as our mock database. With such a large dataset we used Pandas (performed get dummies to data into binary features)to help clean up the data and to start making it a workable file.

# Machine Learning Model
The provisional learning model we ran allowed us to break down the ouptuts to help us with our predictions.
